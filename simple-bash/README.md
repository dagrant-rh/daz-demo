# simple-bash
A simple Bash script that generates audit-like events to stdout.

## Log event format
Events are generated in the following format:

```
Timestamp="<epoch seconds>"
Host="Hostname of the container, derived from $HOSTNAME"
pid="<PID of the process>"
Event="<Name of the audit event, randomly selected from data/events.txt>"
Status="<Status of the event, Success or Failure>"
User="<Firstname and surname of the user, derived from lists of names from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Names"
```

## Example events:

**Note: User names are generated randomly and any resemblance to a real person, is purely coincidental!*

```
Timestamp="1657194208" Host="f95d847050b1" pid="1" Event="admin_logout" Status="Success" User="Romatu Ashby"
Timestamp="1657194213" Host="f95d847050b1" pid="1" Event="deleted_record" Status="Failure" User="Mlelwa de Graaff"

```
